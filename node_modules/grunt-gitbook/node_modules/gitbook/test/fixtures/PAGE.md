# Python basics

Python is a nice language, you can add stuff. Bla bla bla.

Lets jump into an exercise :

---

It's dead simple, `c` must be the sum of `a` and `b`

```py
a = 1
b = 2
```

```py
a = 1
b = 2
c = a + b
```

```py
assert(c, 3)
```

Lets go for another exercise but this time with some context :

---

Exercise with some context code :

Using the `double` function provided, build a `quadruple` function

```py

```

```py

def quadruple(x):
    return double(double(x))

```

```py
assert(quadruple(8), 32)
```

```py

def double(x):
    return x * 2

```
